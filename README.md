# Harmony Across Borders Festival

The Harmony Across Borders Festival is a comprehensive website designed to promote immigration rights and advocacy. It features a fictitious festival taking place over December 8th-10th, supporting the cause of immigration rights and inclusivity.

# Project Overview

Immigrants make up over 46 million of the entire US population and this number continues to grow exponentially. As this number grows, the need for a more efficient pathway to citizenship becomes increasingly dire. It's crucial to support immigration rights because these rights are fundamental to human dignity, equality, and social justice. Often, immigrants face various challenges, including discrimination, limited access to resources, and legal barriers. Raising awareness can help combat prejudices, change policies, and foster a more inclusive society that values diversity. This cause highlights the human aspect of immigration and underscores the need for fair treatment and opportunities for all individuals, regardless of their background or place of origin.

The primary objective of this project is to leverage web design and development skills to craft a visually appealing and user-friendly website for a festival dedicated to immigration rights. By aligning with the cause, the project seeks to raise awareness, educate, and inspire positive change. The festival's website will feature at least five diverse events, each carefully chosen to align with the cause. The overarching goal is to create a digital space that not only showcases a dynamic and inclusive festival lineup but also serves as a catalyst for social change by promoting the values of equality, justice, and unity. Through intentional design decisions and a carefully curated program lineup, the website strives to connect with a wide audience, fostering a sense of community and promoting active advocacy for immigration rights.

The proceeds from the fictitious festival will support United We Dream, a prominent and dedicated organization in the field of immigration rights and advocacy. United We Dream is well-known for its commitment to empowering and advocating for immigrant youth and their families. By supporting United We Dream, the festival will directly contribute to their mission of fighting for a fair and just immigration system, providing essential resources, and assisting those affected by immigration policies. This partnership with United We Dream will have a significant impact on advancing the cause of immigration rights and promoting a more inclusive and equitable society.

The ficitious festival will feature multiple events such as: a symbolic unity walk, a cultural showcase, workshops/panels, community fair, a solidarity concert, a candlelight vigil, and important speakers.

# Technical Overview

The project primarily utilizes HTML and CSS for web development. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is employed to structure the content of the website, defining the various elements and their relationships. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is applied to enhance the visual presentation, styling the HTML elements to create an aesthetically pleasing and cohesive design.

## Responsive Design:

The website is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless and optimal viewing experience across different devices and screen sizes. CSS media queries are implemented to adapt the layout and styling, allowing the content to dynamically adjust to the user's device, whether it be a desktop, tablet, or mobile phone.

## Original Visual Assets:

Original visual assets, including images, graphics, and other design elements, are created using design software. These assets are thoughtfully integrated to enhance the website's visual appeal and convey the festival's theme and message effectively.

## Dynamic Web Features:

To add interactivity and engagement, the website incorporates dynamic web features such as hover effects, transitions, and CSS animations. These elements contribute to a more interactive and visually dynamic user experience, enhancing the overall impact of the festival's online presence.
